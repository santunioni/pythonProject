OOP - Methods

 - Methods (functions) -> methods model the object behavior. This means the actions the object can perform in the\
 system are described by the methods.

In Python, as is the case for attributes, we divide the methods em 2 groups: The class methods and the instance\
 methods.

Instance methods: this are methods that can be called only from objects created within the class model. The class\
 itself can use this methods. For example: user = User(...). The code user.method() works, but User.method() won't.\
 However, you can also access the method for user with the code User(user, ) because the meethods always receive the\
 parameter self.

 - The dunder init method (__init__) is a special method called builder. It's function is to construct objects from the\
 class.

OBS: Every element in Python preceded and ended with duple underline is called dunder (double underline).
OBS: The dunder methods/functions in Python are called magic methods.
ATTENTION: Although we are not forbidden from using dunder while naming our methods, it is not advisable. This can\
conflict with python internal methods if the name you choose is a reserved method.

Class methods: They are not tied to any instance of the class, but only to the class itself. We use decorators to\
 designate class methods. In order languages the class methods are known as static methods.

Static methods: The python static method is different from the class method. It uses the decorator @staticmethod\
 instead of the @classmethod. The static method is static, can't change never. Because of it, it don't receive any\
  parameter as input.
