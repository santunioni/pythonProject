Why testing our code?

Automatic testing!

Why testing our code?
    - Reduce bugs in existent code
    - Tests guarantee new functionality don't break old functionality
    - Tests guarantee corrected problems don't return
    - Tests guarantee refactoring don't bring new bugs

TDD - Test Driven Development:
    - Write your test first
    - Write minimum code to pass the test
    - Refactor the code to implement functionality and test again
    - If test is ok, the functionality is considered implemented


The TDD stages are three:
    - Red;
    - Green;
    - Refactor;
